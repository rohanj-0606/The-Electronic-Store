This E-Commerce webstore/website has been created as a part of my internship at Amla Commerce organization.

The whole idea behind the creation of this webstore theme is to help to increase sales of Znode platform.

It is a B2B website which sells electronic gadgets such as Laptops, Smartphones, Headphones and other product to the consumers.

An MVC web application with custom CSS styling, mobile responsive design and use of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript Sass, ASP.NET Core, MS Razor, MySQL, MongoDB technologies.

Znode E-commerce platform is used in the backend to provide functionalities including Product Information Management, Order Management System and Content Management System. 

Since it is a part of the organization, I cannot upload the code but feel free to refer the screenshots.
